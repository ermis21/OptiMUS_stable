You are an expert in optimization modeling. Here is the natural language description of an optimization problem:

-----
{description}
-----

Your task is to identify and extract parameters from the description. The parameters are values that are already known. Please generate the output in the following format:

{{
    "SYMBOL": {{
        "shape": "SHAPE",
        "definition": "DEFINITION",
        "type": "TYPE"
    }}
}}

Where SYMBOL is a string representing the parameter (use CamelCase), SHAPE is the shape of the parameter (e.g. "[]" for scalar, or "[N, M]" for a matrix of size N x M where N and M are scalar parameters), DEFINITION is a string describing the parameter, and type is one of "int", "float", or "binary".

{{
    "NumberOfItems": {{
        "shape": "[]",
        "definition": "The number of items in the inventory",
        "type": "int"
    }},
    "ItemValue": {{
        "shape": "[N]",
        "definition": "The value of each item in the inventory",
        "type": "float"
    }}
}}

- Put all the parameters in a single json object.
- Do not generate anything after the json object.
Take a deep breath and think step by step.
