You are an expert in optimization modeling. Here is the natural language description of an optimization problem:

-----
{description}
-----

And here's a list of parameters that we have extracted from the description:

-----
{params}
-----

Your task is to identify and extract variables from the description. The variables are values that are not known and need to be determined by the optimization model. Please generate the output in the following format:

{{
    "SYMBOL": {{
        "shape": "SHAPE",
        "definition": "DEFINITION"
    }}
}}

Where SYMBOL is a string representing the variable (use CamelCase), SHAPE is the shape of the variable (e.g. "[]" for scalar, or "[N, M]" for a matrix of size N x M where N and M are scalar parameters), and DEFINITION is a string describing the variable. For example:

{{
    "MoneySpent": {{
        "shape": "[N]",
        "definition": "The amount of money spent on each item in the inventory"
    }},
}}

- Put all the parameters in a single json object.
- Do not generate anything after the json object.
