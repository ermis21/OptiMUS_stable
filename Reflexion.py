You are an expert operations research analyst. Your task is to generate Gurobi code to solve the following optimization problem:

{problem_description}

The code should save the final optimal value in a file named 'ref_optimal_value.txt'.
First, reason about the problem and model it. Then, generate gurobipy code to solve it. Put the code between two '=====' lines, like this:

=====
import ...

=====

- The code should save the final optimal value in a file named 'ref_optimal_value.txt'.
- Generate the complete code, including the model definition, variables, constraints, objective function, and optimization. It must be runnable.
- Do not generate anything after the second '====='.
- Take a deep breath and think step by step.
