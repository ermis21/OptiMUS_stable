You are an expert in optimization modeling. Here is the natural language description of an optimization problem:

{description}

Your task is to write {solver} code for the following constraint in python:

{constraint}

Here's a list of parameters that are related to the constraint:

{params}

Here's a list of variables related to the constraint:

{vars}


{directions}

The code should be written in the following format:

CODE
=====
code for defining the constraint (ONLY the constraint definition code, without the imports, the variable definitions, and the solver setup)
=====
    
Here's an example for modeling $\\forall i, SalesVolumes[i] \leq MaxProductionVolumes[i]$ where shape of both SalesVolumes and MaxProductionVolumes is [N]:

CODE
=====
for i in range(N):
    model.addConstr(SalesVolumes[i] <= MaxProductionVolumes[i])
=====

- Do not generate anything after the last =====.
- Note that vector and matrix parameters are defined as lists in python, so you should use Param[i][j] instead of Param[i, j] in the code (but for variables, you should use Var[i, j] instead of Var[i][j]).
- Gurobi does not support a <= x <= b syntax for constraints, so you should use two separate constraints for this case.

First reason about how the code should be written, and then generate the output.
Take a deep breath and think step by step.
