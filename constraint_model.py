text = """
To model the optimization constraint "The amount of stock held from one period to the next incurs a holding cost," we need to first understand that the holding cost is a cost incurred for maintaining stock in the warehouse from one period to the next. This cost is proportional to the amount of stock held and the holding cost per unit.

Let’s denote:
- $\text{holdingCost}$ as the cost of holding one unit of product per period.
- $\text{stockLevel}_n$ as the stock level at the end of period $n$.

The holding cost for one period is then given by $\text{holdingCost} \times \text{stockLevel}_n$. Our goal is to include this cost in the objective function of our MILP formulation, affecting the profit maximization.

However, since the request is for a constraint formulation rather than directly incorporating this cost into the objective function, the likely intent is to ensure that the stock levels and their associated costs are properly tracked. While directly constraining the holding cost is unconventional without specific cost limits, we ensure proper stock level management through auxiliary constraints.

Here’s the step-by-step approach to formulation:

1. **Track stock levels**: Ensure the stock level in each period is updated correctly based on purchases and sales.

Now, I'll generate the output JSON file with the required constraint formulation:

```json
{
    "FORMULATION": "$\forall n, \\text{holdingCost} \times \\text{stockLevel}[n]$",
    "NEW VARIABLES": {},
    "AUXILIARY CONSTRAINTS": [
        "$\\text{profit} = \sum_{n=1}^{NumPeriods} \\left(\\text{Price}[n] \times \\text{sellAmount}[n] - \\text{Cost}[n] \times \\text{buyAmount}[n] - \\text{holdingCost} \times \\text{stockLevel}[n]\\right)$",
        "$\\text{profit} = \\text{maximize}(\\text{profit})$"
    ]
}
```

Explanation:
1. **FORMULATION**: This is the mathematical representation showing that holding cost is calculated as $\text{holdingCost} \times \text{stockLevel}[n]$.

2. **NEW VARIABLES**: No new variables are introduced.

3. **AUXILIARY CONSTRAINTS**:
   - The first auxiliary constraint shows the objective function incorporating the holding cost into the profit calculation.
   - The second auxiliary constraint states the maximization of profit.

Note: The initial constraint provided seems to be more of a statement for incorporating holding costs into the profit function rather than a strict boundary constraint, and thus is reflected appropriately in the auxiliary constraints.

And here's a list of all variables that we have defined so far to model the problem as an (MI)LP:

Your task is to model the following constraint mathematically in LaTeX for the MILP formulation:

{constraint}

The constraints are the conditions that must be satisfied by the variables. Please generate the output in the following json format:

{{
    "FORMULATION": constraint formulation in LaTeX, between $...$,
    "NEW VARIABLES": {{
        symbol: {{    
            "shape": shape of the new variable (e.g. [], [N], [N, M]),
            "type": type of the new variable (e.g. binary, integer, continuous),
            "definition": definition of the new variable in natural language
        }},
        ...
    }},
    "AUXILIARY CONSTRAINTS": [

        Latex formulation for auxiliary constraint 2, between $...$,

Here's an example output (where SalesVolumePerStore is already defined as a variable in the vars list):

    }},
    "AUXILIARY CONSTRAINTS": [
        "$\\forall i, SalesVolumes[i] = \\sum_j SalesVolumesPerStore[i, j]$"
    ]
}}

- If you need any new variables, you can define them in the NEW VARIABLES list. Use {{}} for "NEW VARIABLES" if no new variables are needed.
- Use [] for AUXILIARY CONSTRAINTS list if no auxiliary constraints are needed.
- You can only use symbols of existing parameters and integer numbers for dimensions of new variables.
- Use camelCase for variable symbols (e.g. SalesVolumes). Do not use LaTeX formatting (e.g. X_{{color}}), indices (e.g. SalesVolume_{{i}}), and underlines (_) for variable symbols.
- Do not generate anything after the json file!

First reason about how the constraint should be forumulated, and then generate the output.
